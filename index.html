            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>My vision for this website is to be a friendly forum for computer enthusiasts, with opensource resources for Cyber Security, game dev, web dev and more. <br>
                I feel current  social media and message boards have lost their unique feel. <br>
                I'm hoping to finish out this website and host it locally on my own private network. That way I can develop my backend skills  without having to pay for a domain or go through the risks
                of hosting a public  domain.  <br>
                I haven't been logging my progress, but I'll start doing that going forward to show my progress as I continue my journey.
            </p>
            <h2>Updates</h2>
            <li>03/11/23 - Added a cookie button on the index page. Cookie page will have a falling cookie game, where you click the cookies. The amount of cookies will be stored in a browser cookie.</li>
            <li> 02/25/23 - Wanting to create the webpages dynamically, seems like a server side request sort of thing, so just keeping it static for now.</li>
            <li>02/25/23 - Added Cyber Security threads using a generated JSON file by chat gpt for fake data. Used Object data to create threads.</li>
            <li> 02/18/23 - Added a Feedback Form that demonstrates using arrays and converting to a string.</li>
            <li> 02/14/23 - Create a push effect when opening the sidebar.</li>
            <li> 02/14/23 - Centered create account page </li>
            <li> 02/14/23 - Added Forum Cards for AI, Cyber Security, and Software Development. Included some icons and updated the CSS.</li>
            <li> 02/12/23 - Adding a create account page with customer input validations. Added a link to the top of the homepage.</li>
            <li> 02/04/23 - I'm dedicating much more effort and time into this website. This is the first log post, with many more to come regarding updates on bitHaven's future, features, and roadmap. </li>
